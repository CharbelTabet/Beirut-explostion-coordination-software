# Beirut Explosion Coordination Panel

## Background
Beirut has witnessed on 04/08/2020 one of the biggest explosion in mankind's history that has resulted in 180 deaths, 6,000 injuries, US$10â€“15 billion in property damage, and leaving an estimated 300,000 people homeless ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Beirut_explosion)).

## What happened next
In the absence of a proper government, individuals and NGOs have rushed to the streets to mainly help with:

- Cleaning of debris
- Reconstruction
- Food distribution
- Taking care of the wonded
- Looking after the missing
- Surveying, Consulting and other analysis work

## Data collections problems
Concerning data collection and donations allocations to the ones in need, NGOs and individuals have been seen heavily relying on:

- Excel sheets
- Paper notebooks
- Whatsapp groups 

Forwarding to each others, in an asynchronous matter messy excel sheets over whatsapp or over widely shared google drives among anyone who ever volunteered in data collection and to which remain read and write access.

## What our coordination panel is here to provide
Our software is here to provide **first** a geolocation service:
1. Real time updated map about the volunteering positions (which is where help is given)

2. Map of the damaged homes (which is where help should be redirected)
